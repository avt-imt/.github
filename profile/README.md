# AVT-IMT — who are we?

This GitHub organization is a team of researchers who are working on methods, tools, and solutions for the assessment of multimedia technology.
Key aspect of our approach is to consider both the user and technical information (system parameters, signals) in the assessment of technology.

We are current members of [Audiovisual Technology Group (AVT)](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/audio-visual-technology/), Institute for Media Technology (IMT) of Technische Universität Ilmenau, Germany

In the past we open-sourced projects which are hosted within the [Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment](https://github.com/Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment/) GitHub organization.
